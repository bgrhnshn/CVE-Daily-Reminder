## ðŸ›  Pre-requisites

- Ensure you have AWS CDK installed and configured.
- Have a Slack channel set up for receiving notifications.

## ðŸ›  Technologies Used

This project is built upon a robust stack of technologies that ensure reliability, scalability, and efficiency. Here's a list of the major technologies and services employed:

- **AWS CDK**: The AWS Cloud Development Kit (CDK) is a software development framework for defining cloud infrastructure in code and provisioning it through AWS CloudFormation.

- **AWS Lambda**: AWS Lambda lets you run code without provisioning or managing servers, ensuring scalability and fault tolerance.

- **EventBridge**: AWS EventBridge is a serverless event bus service that makes it easy to connect applications using data from different sources.

- **Slack**: Slack is where the daily CVE reminders are delivered, providing an easy-to-use platform for team communication.

- **NIST**: The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) is a key resource for the latest Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs).
